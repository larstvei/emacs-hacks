;;; Commentary:

;; This is a very simple utility that let's you evaluate expressions on the
;; fly. Calculations are determined by special characters.

;;; Tutorial:

;; * denote the calculations beginning by entering "" (w/ quotes)
;; * enter the equation itself
;; * press "=" (w/ quotes) and let emacs evaluate the calculation
;;
;; Example: ยง 1+2+3 = 6
;;          ^   ^   ^ ^

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'inline-calculation-mode)

;;; Code:

(provide 'inline-calculation-mode)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))
